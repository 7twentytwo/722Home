				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PrestaShop, the free and open-source software, owes a great deal to its community, which helps improve it every day. There are lots of ways to pitch in, from modifying the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop" target="_blank">source code</a>, or providing feedback on <a href="http://forge.prestashop.com/" target="_blank">Forge</a>, to creating <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/" target="_blank">modules</a> or even participating in user tests. Although more discreet, the community’s involvement in the <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official" target="_blank">PrestaShop translation project</a> has nonetheless made it possible to make the software available in nearly 65 languages. That lets sellers around the world open their shops for free and in their own language.<span id="more-22523"></span></p>
<p>With the arrival of <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/1.7" target="_blank">version 1.7</a> and new features, there’s new content that needs to be translated. Now more than ever before, PrestaShop needs its community to rally together.</p>
<h2 style="color:#251b5b;">Translate PrestaShop</h2>
<p>Our translation project involves translating the PrestaShop software into more than 80 languages. In true open-source fashion, anyone who wants to help is welcome to do so. Some languages are already done (but improvements can always be made), while others are still being translated, and some are barely started.</p>
<p>Do you want to join the translation community? It’s easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account on <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official" target="_blank">Crowdin</a>.</li>
<li>Request to join the PrestaShop project for the language you want to translate.</li>
<li>Translate the software from English.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information on our <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official" target="_blank">translation project page</a> (in English).<br />

<h2 style="color:#251b5b;">Thanks to our community of translators</h2>
<p>Since the project was launched on Crowdin in 2014, <strong>more than 1,100 translators have translated more than 3 million words in 72 languages</strong>. That’s huge!</p>
<p>To highlight the translators’ work and thank them, we recently created a site in their honor. That’s where you can find the biggest contributors since the launch of the 1.7 version. You can also follow the progress of ongoing translations:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the eCommerce businesses’ biggest challenges after the holidays is how to market to customers who are marketed out? After they’ve been bombarded with sales and discounts and offers from Black Friday on, how can marketers coax them out of the post-holiday slump?</p>
<p>Offering your customers a fresh perspective for the New Year, encouraging them to buy something for themselves, nurturing new loyalty club members with targeted offers and other strategies can all help bring customers to your site and keep your sales from taking a nosedive.</p>
<p>Here how to have a high-performing post-holiday season:<span id="more-22517"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#CF763A;">1. Offer big sales on leftover holiday stock</h2>
<p>Some people live for post-holiday liquidations. And even those who don’t usually participate in them can be tempted by a sale that’s too good to pass up.</p>
<p>It’s also a great way for you to get rid of retail “perishables” like food, fads or anything with 2016 blazoned on it. Deep discounts help drive traffic to your site to get rid of old stock, and while they’re at it, customers might pick up some other items too. </p>
<h2 style="color:#CF763A;">2. Grant permission to self-indulge</h2>
<p>Many people enjoy the holidays, but it can also be very stressful with all the planning, cooking, cleaning, buying, traveling, dealing with family dynamics, etc.</p>
<p>The holidays are also about giving to others, and after the festivities are over, your customers may be in need of something that offers a dose of “this is for me.”</p>
<p>Switch it up and market to the customer who wants to feel good about self-gifting. </p>
<h2 style="color:#CF763A;">3. Change the focus to New Year’s</h2>
<p>Come January 1, holiday hedonism turns into the portrait of austerity and self-restraint. Quitting drinking, quitting smoking, losing weight, eating healthier and other similar resolutions top the list every year.</p>
<p>Ads that suggest <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/after-the-holiday-spike/" target="_blank">helping customers with their New Year’s resolutions</a> can bring in results. Messages about health, positive outlooks, renewal, make-overs and plans for the future all have a resolution-y ring to them. </p>
<h2 style="color:#CF763A;">4. Use their holiday purchase history</h2>
<p>This can be tricky because customers were often buying gifts for other people in the months leading up to the holidays. That means that you should make the discount or promotion shareable.</p>
<p>Target the customer who bought the product, but make sure they understand that someone else can use the discount. If, for example, they bought a Keurig coffee maker pre-holiday, send them a discount on related items such as coffee pods, coffee mugs, coasters and other relevant items.</p>
<p>Encourage them to share the discount with friends. That way you cover all the bases if the gift was for themselves or another person AND it gives you the opportunity to increase you customer base if they do share the promotion.</p>
<h2 style="color:#CF763A;">5. Conduct a poll</h2>
<p>Start the New Year off by communicating directly with your customers with a poll. Polls are a really good way to engage your client base. They accomplish a lot of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They get customers thinking about your business.</li>
<li>They offer customers a place to voice their praise or criticism.</li>
<li>They give you an insight into what you need to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through polls, you can find out things like what new items they plan to buy this year, what’s more important to them price or quality, how satisfied they are with your services, which platform they most prefer to receive messages (social, SMS or email) and other information.</p>
<h2 style="color:#CF763A;">6. Nurture clients with SMS</h2>
<p>If you did a big SMS opt-in campaign push for the holidays, now’s the time when it’s really going to pay off. And if you haven’t done one yet, now’s the good time to start.</p>
<p>Don’t leave your customers hanging once the holidays have passed. Instead, <a href="https://www.textmagic.com/blog/brands-use-sms-texting-in-business/" target="_blank">continue building the relationship with these and other SMS marketing ideas</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Personalized messages.</em> Give your message a personal touch by using your client’s name. Use their purchasing preferences to send out the promotions on items they might like.</li>
<li><em>Special discounts only for SMS loyalty club members.</em> Make your promotions unique to SMS customers so they see the benefit of having signed up and have an incentive to stay opted in.</li>
<li><em>Useful tips.</em> Offer advice on how to care for a product they bought.</li>
<li><em>Customer service.</em> Let them know you received a returned item and send a confirmation of credit issued to them via text. If they’ve ordered a new product, keep them updated on the shipping status with an SMS message.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:#CF763A;">7. Use social media</h2>
<p>Social media works as a marketing platform any time of the year, including post-holiday. Use photos and videos to promote discounts and show off new merchandise. <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/17-tips-for-successful-facebook-contests/" target="_blank">Running contests on social media</a> is a popular way to get people to visit your site. Most retailers run pre-holiday contests.</p>
<p>Be unconventional and run a post-holiday contest. For example, participants could post their New Year’s resolutions to enter a sweepstakes. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret that <strong>local results on Google have experienced a spike recently</strong>, and the most recent changes to the company&#8217;s search algorithm have continued this trend. Although <strong>not yet confirmed by Google</strong>, local search results have been pursuing a steady climb since September and <strong>SEO experts are now abuzz about the company&#8217;s new algorithm</strong>, which they say has accounted for a high number of possums. In this article, we explain everything you need to know to benefit from the new advantages of Google&#8217;s most recent changes.<span id="more-22503"></span></p>
<h2 style="color:#5279b7">Why are they called possums?</h2>
<p>First of all, we&#8217;d like to specify that Google has not confirmed any changes to its local results algorithm. As such, <strong>the unofficial name</strong> is merely <strong>a term chosen by SEO experts</strong>. To be more specific, the local result visibility expert <a href="https://twitter.com/philrozek" target="_blank">Phil Rozek</a> suggested it when certain companies told him that their web pages had disappeared from Google My Business. In reality, they hadn&#8217;t disappeared, but were “playing dead” or — in his words — &#8220;playing possum.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Google was actually filtering a whole lot of results from Google My Business</strong>, which made business owners think that the tech company had purposefully scratched them off the list. And so was born a new and improved local SEO option for quality and content links.</p>
<h2 style="color:#5279b7">What effects will these changes have?</h2>
<p>From the looks of it, <strong>the changes directly affect local results and those on Google Maps</strong>, modifying sites listed in 3-packs of local results (formerly 7-packs) and those displayed when clicking on &#8220;more sites.&#8221; As always, these changes are visible on everything in the Google USA SERP, although it can be expected that the changes will be gradually applied in all supported countries. It is also likely that you&#8217;ll soon see a difference for customized pages affected by the changes. In other words, you will be able to anticipate changes to local SEO.</p>
<p>All in all, given what has been observed in recent weeks, the algorithm is <strong>penalizing pages that have the same domain name or telephone number on Google My Business. Pages that do not indicate their location are not exempt</strong>, nor are those for which the location doesn&#8217;t correspond with business user searches on Google.</p>
<h2 style="color:#5279b7">Who has benefited from this?</h2>
<p>Although local searches put some pages at a disadvantage, others have seen major benefits from the algorithm changes, with overnight spikes in 3-pack rankings on Google in some cases. Now for some of the changes at SEO level.</p>
<h4 style="color:#5279b7">Improvements for businesses located in city limits</h4>
<p>When Google local SEO was redone, businesses located on the edge of city limits began having problems improving their ranking, given the number of competitors inside the city. According to Google, however, some of these businesses are located outside of the locality they feel they belong to.<br />
Nevertheless, since the algorithm change, some pages (with an accurate SEO positioning) have seen their rankings go up automatically. Google has begun taking this into account for its local results as well.</p>
<h4 style="color:#5279b7">Filtering by address to improve user experience</h4>
<p>In the past, Google has used domain and telephone number to filter duplicates in local results. Following the changes made to its algorithm, Google will also <strong>evaluate and filter multiple accounts with the same physical address so that only one of the pages is displayed</strong>. For example, imagine you&#8217;re a specialized law firm with lawyers practicing different types of law. You would only be allowed one account per firm or per branch of law (marriage, labor, criminal, etc.). Another example could be a private hospital, for which specialists would have their own cabinet. </p>
<p>If each individual branch is displayed with the same address and on the same page, Google will consider these to be duplicate content, which the SEO would filter. Only the result with the highest placed local search result would be shown. Take the example of searching for a lawyer: what is the point of showing you the same address three or four times? </p>
<p>Although Google has been doing this for some time, things have changed. Now, each time that businesses are filtered, they are penalized or promoted so that the search engine can determine one&#8217;s pertinence over another in result lists and rank them in the local SEO results.</p>
<h4 style="color:#5279b7">Physical location of users — an increasingly important concept</h4>
<p>This is harmful to the SEO ranking of businesses that deal in a broad but local geographic location because the system benefits the most local businesses. Even if results are in a nearby neighboring region, <strong>Google will give priority to the businesses that are closest to a user</strong> at the moment they hit search. Google&#8217;s SERP will be different for &#8220;service+city&#8221; queries, even when the search request is for an exact match (all the same keywords), if the results are found in different cities.</p>
<p>For example, if you search for &#8220;lawyers+Madrid&#8221;, the results will be different if you are looking only in Madrid or if you are looking in Barcelona, despite the terms used in your query. The reason for this is that Google gives higher importance to the user&#8217;s IP address when deciding where to look.</p>
<h4 style="color:#5279b7">Slight changes to keywords yield different results</h4>
<p>Before changes were made to Google&#8217;s algorithm, if you searched for &#8220;lawyers in Madrid,&#8221; &#8220;Madrid lawyers,&#8221; or &#8220;Lawyer Madrid,&#8221; the results would have been either the same, very similar, or would have contained some of the same pages.</p>
<p>With the new algorithm, <strong>results are more variable, including for pages in 3-packs and searches with similar results included</strong>. This could mean that Google is still making changes to its algorithm in order to tweak and improve it.</p>
<h4 style="color:#5279b7">Local results, increasingly separate from organic search</h4>
<p>It seems that even if Google considers a page to be a duplicate and filters it through the SERP, it can still appear in local results. Additionally, <strong>some pages may appear</strong> as duplicates <strong>in both ordinary results and local 3-pack results</strong>, since these seem to be functioning separately. That would imply that some businesses may be benefiting from double visibility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Code Better; Create Easier; Sell Faster&#8221;: <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/1.7" target="_blank">PrestaShop 1.7</a> offers real improvements for everyone involved in creating an online shop: developers, theme designers and merchants.<span id="more-22468"></span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Sell Faster&#8221; is designed for our users, merchants.</strong></p>
<p>The product department committed to making their lives easier. That is what user-oriented design is all about.</p>
<p>When a merchant chooses PrestaShop, it is for one simple reason: to be able to sell their products or services. </p>
<p>This may seem obvious, but what it implies is vital: if they are immediately given the full array of options offered by the software, they will feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>E-commerce is becoming more and more common and some less experienced merchants are entering the market. We wanted to make the early stages of using our software easier, and support them during the first vital steps towards becoming an e-merchant.</p>
<p>Therefore, we focused on a few key tasks upon creating an online shop. The goal was to make them more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
<p>Hence, the features were not seen as an end in itself, but rather as a &#8220;simple&#8221; means to accomplish these tasks.</p>
<p>More experienced users, i.e. companies looking for a powerful but simple software program after years in the e-commerce business, also wanted a more user-friendly product to support their development.</p>
<p>The 1.7.0 version is the result an analysis conducted on tens of thousands of e-shops and numerous interviews, surveys and tests.</p>
<p>As a result, we redesigned the user interface for:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Early Stages of Using PrestaShop: <br />
We have clearly indicated the 6 key steps to create your online shop. This simplified initial process is not mandatory. It is more of a guide to help you if you need it.</li>
<li>Creating Products: <br />
We made creating simple products less time-consuming. Instead of about fifteen minutes, it will now take you less than five. This is obviously essential, as without any products you will not receive any orders. We also made mass product creation easier by enabling the use of new file formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Managing your shop from the back office is quicker and more efficient, and the product upload time has been reduced drastically. These two improvements favor a very short Time to Market, especially during key sales periods or internationalizations!</p>
<p>We have surveyed our user club and visited numerous merchants to have their feedback on how to improve user experience. If you also want to take part in our product tests, sign up to our <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/club/" target="_blank">club</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of you in Europe and throughout the world* took part in our survey about preparing your online store for the holiday season. We made a promise and we&#8217;re keeping it!</p>
<p>We have assessed the impact on your business and habits during that crucial peak sales time, the Christmas Holiday period.</p>
<p>Find out about the 2015-2016 e-commerce trends and outlook. <span id="more-22475"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #251b5b;font-weight: bold"><a title="Infographic : E-Commerce Trends &amp; Outlook 2016" href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/christmas-holidays-2015-2016-e-commerce-trends-outlook/infographie_en/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22520"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22520" alt="infographie_EN" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/12/infographie_EN.jpg" width="700" height="2277" /></a></h2>
<h2 style="color: #251b5b;font-weight: bold">2015 Report – Christmas Holiday period significant, but less so than last year with sales smoothed out over the year.</h2>
<p>The Christmas Holiday period is crucial for e-merchants.</p>
<p>This year, 29% of e-merchants surveyed estimate that the Christmas Holiday period represents between 10 and 25% of their revenue. 15% estimate that it represents more than 25%.</p>
<p>However, and this is a significant figure, more than half (57%) estimate that it represents less than 10% of their revenue. The Christmas Holiday share of revenue is thus decreasing, and e-merchants are managing to smooth their revenue more successfully over the year. The reason for that is the increase in promotional periods throughout the year: Black Friday, Cyber Monday, sales, Valentine&#8217;s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, etc. See our <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/11539-uk-ecommerce-calendar.html" target="_blank">e-commerce calendar</a>.</p>
<h2 style="color: #251b5b;font-weight: bold">Outlook for the 2016 season</h2>
<p>The good news is that e-merchants are quite optimistic about their prospective sales this year: 72% estimate that their revenue will be higher than last year in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Recruitment</strong> – 14% of online stores are planning to hire staff specifically for the holiday period. That is a good sign and can be correlated with the results of e-merchants for whom the holiday period represents more than 10% of their revenue (15% in total).</p>
<p>For those recruiting for the holiday period, the most sought-after profiles are mainly for <strong>staff to deal with taking orders and returned packages (28%).</strong> These are followed by <strong>e-mail and social media marketers (20%) and web developers (18%). </strong></p>
<h2 style="color: #251b5b;font-weight: bold">Christmas Holiday preparations</h2>
<p>76% of European e-merchants state that they prepare their online store for the Christmas Holiday period. 90% of them do so <strong>1 to 3 months in advance</strong>. So e-merchants decide on their main action plan for the Christmas Holidays <strong>in October</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What are their 3 main objectives for this period?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1/ Preparing their online store</strong> – festive design, adding product pages, promotional offers, etc., all of which explain the importance of recruiting web designers and developers.</p>
<p><strong>2/ Preparing</strong> targeted <strong>promotional e-mail campaigns</strong> to boost the number of orders and the average cart size.</p>
<p><strong>3/ An optimum inventory level</strong>, neither too big nor too small, but one that strikes a happy medium to avoid being left with unsold stock after the holiday period, and to avoid having inventory shortages that result in the immediate loss of a sale.</p>
<h2 style="color: #251b5b;font-weight: bold">The mobile share of Christmas Holiday e-commerce revenue</h2>
<p>For e-merchants in a position to state this (78% of respondents), <strong>the share of revenue made via mobile devices over the holiday period is 17%</strong> on average.</p>
<p>However, almost 22% of respondents had no idea about the volume of mobile sales in their revenue.</p>
<p>From that we can conclude that there is still a considerable amount of room for optimizing e-commerce websites for mobile devices. Simple methods for assessing the volume of revenue from mobile devices can be set up via <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/features/mobile-site-traffic.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>. This enables e-merchants to identify the most effective mobile platforms for their e-commerce.</p>
<h2 style="color: #251b5b;font-weight: bold">The importance of social media in an e-commerce marketing strategy</h2>
<p>Social media is considered to be important in the e-merchant&#8217;s marketing strategy in Poland: 57% consider it crucial in communications during the Christmas period, and 35% consider it to be quite important.</p>
<p>* Sample of those surveyed: <strong>1,305</strong> e-merchants active in Europe and <strong>1,898</strong> throughout the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jayasilen, our Ambassador of Malaysia, is working in Kuala Lumpur for a nutritional supplements company, where he is in charge of the online business, through a store powered by PrestaShop. He is the proof that PrestaShop is easy to use and user-friendly, as him and his assistant don’t have an IT background. To reward his loyalty, we chose him to be the Ambassador of November! Check out below his great answers to our questions. <span id="more-22433"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #df0067"> About you </h2>
<p><strong>Three words to best describe you:</strong><br />
Introvert, equanimous and avant-garde.</br><br />
<strong>If you were to write a book about yourself, what would you name it?</strong><br />
<em>My search for meaning.</em></br><br />
<strong>What is your hidden talent?</strong><br />
I am passionate about Taekwondo, dancing and film-making.<br />
<img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/11/taekwondo.jpg" alt="taekwondo" width="960" height="636" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22435" /><em>Jayasilen practising his favourite sport, Taekwondo</em></br><br />
<strong>A favorite line from a movie?</strong><br />
This is a tough one. There’s a lot of quotes from the Rocky series that I find very relatable, inspiring and touching but here is one of my favourites.</p>
<p><em>“Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain&#8217;t all sunshine and rainbows. It&#8217;s a very mean and nasty place, and I don&#8217;t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain&#8217;t about how hard you hit. It&#8217;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That&#8217;s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you&#8217;re worth, then go out and get what you&#8217;re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain&#8217;t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain&#8217;t you. You&#8217;re better than that! I&#8217;m always gonna love you, no matter what. No matter what happens. You&#8217;re my son and you&#8217;re my blood. You&#8217;re the best thing in my life. But until you start believing in yourself, you ain&#8217;t gonna have a life.”</em><br />
<em>― Sylvester Stallone, Rocky Balboa ―</em></p>
<p>P.S.: Go watch Rocky if you have not and you will definitely find some meaning in life.<br />
<img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/11/rocky.jpg" alt="rocky" width="460" height="289" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22436" /></br><br />

</br></p>
<p><strong>If you could travel anywhere right now, where would you go and why?</strong><br />
Travel Europe to visit a bunch of friends that I recently met while participating to ITF Taekwondo World Cup in Budapest and in particular Paris to catch-up with the PrestaShop folks!</p>
<h2 style="color: #df0067">About your country</h2>
<p><strong>What is your favorite local food or drink?</strong><br />
Mom’s cooking of course, especially the sambal dishes that she makes! However, I do enjoy eating at Chinese restaurants as well.<br />
 <img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/11/plat.jpg" alt="plat" width="550" height="550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22437" /><br />
<em>Sambal Belacan – credits: Recipeshubs</em></br></p>
<p><strong>Give us a fun fact about your country: </strong><br />
Malaysians are one of the friendliest people in the world…well at least on Facebook! According to Digital Life study by the global research company TNS in 2010, Malaysians on average have 233 friends on their social networks, compared with the world average of 119! Well the numbers could have changed in 2016 but hey, I think Malaysians are still considered to be friendly.</p>
<h2 style="color: #df0067">About PrestaShop</h2>
<p><strong>What opportunities does PrestaShop provide in your country?</strong><br />
Malaysia is one of the countries with the highest mobile and internet penetration rate. Online shopping has grown tremendously over the last 5 years and a lot of businesses (start-ups and large corporations) are listing their products in common marketplaces to tap into this growing market. PrestaShop is a great free e-commerce platform not only for start-ups and SMEs in Malaysia but also for ASEAN’s. More options for localised payment gateway, shipping and marketplace connectors would make the solution even greater.</p>
<p><strong>What is your feedback on the new major version, PrestaShop 1.7?</strong><br />
The new PrestaShop 1.7 feels very light and seamless. The front office with the new start-up theme looks simpler and more modern, which is very much in-line with the trend. The back-office navigation is also very user-friendly. I installed a few 1.6 modules on a test site running on PrestaShop 1.7 and it seems to work fine so far. Certainly, 1.7 is a good upgrade for PrestaShop.</p>
<h2 style="color: #df0067">About being an Ambassador</h2>
<p><strong>What is your proudest moment as a PrestaShop Ambassador?</strong><br />
Being the first PrestaShop Ambassador of Malaysia and also organising the first PrestaShop meetup in Asia!</p>
<p><strong>What do you like the most about being an Ambassador?</strong><br />
What I like the most about being an Ambassador is the awesome support by the PrestaShop team, exclusive updates about the upcoming releases and their super cool gifts. The Preston figurine is my daughter’s favourite toy in the car. Most importantly, I like to assist people on PrestaShop and ecommerce whenever they need more information and assistance. It gives me a sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>A last word?</strong><br />
Gone are the days where it requires a lot of expertise and money to develop a comprehensive e-commerce site with full control. With PrestaShop, businesses now can have their own e-commerce site with minimal effort and budget, regardless of their IT background.</p>
<p>Moreover with PrestaShop Addons marketplace, your e-commerce site can incorporate more customized and sophisticated functions which you can leverage to better serve your customers.</p>
<p>If you are planning to have an e-commerce site anytime soon, please check-out PrestaShop. You may not end-up using it but I’m pretty sure it is worth considering!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much Jayasilen!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away.”</em><br />
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
<p><span id="more-22404"></span>There is probably no better quote to depict how we’ve achieved one of the most important improvement of PrestaShop 1.7: its new Theme structure. In previous versions of PrestaShop, creating a new theme was a developer task. It required a large technical skillset (HTML, CSS, Smarty and PrestaShop itself), and a lot of business logic was happening inside the templates. As a result, the Themes were only built on top of the default Theme.</p>
<p>That’s why we came up with a better solution to create and maintain a theme: a Starter Theme and a new Default Theme. Our goal is to enable anyone to create an awesome theme with only basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, in only half the time it took with PrestaShop 1.6.</p>
<p>We call <a href="http://build.prestashop.com/news/starter-theme-news-2/" target="_blank">Starter Theme</a> our minimal PrestaShop 1.7 theme: it is feature-complete but has no styling, and thus nothing to take away… which is perfect for Theme designers because it saves a lot of time when implementing a new design. It also allows them to create a production-ready theme with any front-end technology upon a strong foundation.</p>
<p>The new Default Theme, called <a href="http://build.prestashop.com/news/new-theme-1-7-introduction/" target="_blank">“Classic”</a>, is the free theme you can use when starting off your business. It is classy and efficient, based on the Starter Theme, includes Bootstrap 4 framework, and has been designed to be visually light and neutral, while delivering <a href="http://build.prestashop.com/news/Designing-the-new-PrestaShop-default-theme/" target="_blank">the best web and e-commerce practices</a>. Of course, it is mobile-responsive and still entirely adjustable and customizable, to allow every online shop to be singular. One of the highlights of “Classic” is a <a href="http://build.prestashop.com/news/starter-theme-news-3/" target="_blank">one-page checkout</a> by default. It makes editing the order very easy, displays a cart recap always at customers’ sight and allows customers to anticipate the steps before payment. All of these user experience improvements help in turn your conversion rate.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the feature of <a href="http://developers.prestashop.com/themes/smarty/parent-child-feature.html" target="_blank">Parent/Child inheritance</a> will make it easy to modify a template without having to change the source file. Which then makes updating your theme (for bug fix, security…) completely seamless while leaving your customization untouched.</p>
